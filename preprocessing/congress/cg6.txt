        voice and character;
Whereas speech and debate education gives students the 21st century skills of 
        communication, critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration;
Whereas critical analysis and effective communication allow important ideas, 
        texts, and philosophies the opportunity to flourish;
Whereas personal, professional, and civic interactions are enhanced by the 
        ability of the participants in those interactions to listen, concur,

        activity that requires regular practice, dedication, and hard work;

        opportunities;
Whereas National Speech and Debate Education Day emphasizes the lifelong impact 
        of providing people of the United States with the confidence and 
        preparation to both discern and share views;
Whereas National Speech and Debate Education Day acknowledges that most 
        achievements, celebrations, commemorations, and pivotal moments in 
        modern history begin, end, or are crystallized with public address;
Whereas National Speech and Debate Education Day recognizes that learning to 
        research, construct, and present an argument is integral to personal 
        advocacy, social movements, and the making of public policy;

        and local partners, honors and celebrates the importance of speech and 
        debate through National Speech and Debate Education Day; and
