                lists, seminars, workshops, trainings, or other 
                educational or professional settings in a manner that 
                could reasonably give rise to the appearance of 
                official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement;
                    (B) to contract with, hire, or otherwise engage

                the race of the individual;
                    (E) an individual, by virtue of the race of the 
                individual, is inherently racist or oppressive, whether 
                consciously or unconsciously; or
                    (F) an individual, because of the race of the 
                individual, bears responsibility for the actions 
                committed by members of the race of the individual.
