To prohibit the award of Federal funds to schools that promote certain 
        race-based theories to students, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Combating Racist Teaching in Schools 
Act'' or the ``CRT Act''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON AWARD OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO CERTAIN SCHOOLS.

    (a) Prohibition on Award of Funds to Certain Elementary and 
Secondary Schools.--No Federal funds received by a State or local 
educational agency may be allocated to an elementary or secondary 
school that promotes the race-based theories described in subsection 
(c) or compels teachers or students to affirm, adhere to, adopt, or 
process beliefs in a manner that violates title VI of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964.
    (b) Prohibition on Award of Funds to Certain Institutions of Higher 
Education.--No Federal funds may be awarded to an institution of higher 
education if such institution promotes the race-based theories 
described in subsection (c) or compels teachers or students to affirm, 
adhere to, adopt, or process beliefs in a manner that violates title VI 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
    (c) Race-Based Theories Described.--The race-based theories 
described in this subsection are the following:
            (1) Any race is inherently superior or inferior to any 
        other race, color, or national origin.
            (2) The United States is a fundamentally racist country.
            (3) The Declaration of Independence or Constitution of the 
        United States are fundamentally racist documents.
            (4) An individual's moral character or worth is determined 
        by the individual's race, color, or national origin.
            (5) An individual, by virtue of the individual's race, is 
        inherently racist or oppressive, whether consciously or 
        unconsciously.
            (6) An individual, because of the individual's race, bears 
        responsibility for the actions committed by other members of 
        the individual's race, color, or national origin.
    (d) Rules of Construction.--
            (1) Protected speech not restricted.--Nothing in this 
        section shall be construed to restrict the speech of a student, 
        teacher, or any other individual outside of a school setting.
            (2) Access to materials for the purpose of research or 
        independent study.--Nothing in this section shall be construed 
        to prevent an individual from accessing materials that advocate 
        theories described in subsection (c) for the purpose of 
        research or independent study.
            (3) Contextual education.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        construed to prevent a covered school from stating theories 
        described in subsection (c) or assigning materials that 
        advocate such theories for educational purposes in contexts 
        that make it clear the school does not sponsor, approve, or 
        endorse such theories or materials.
    (e) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Covered school.--The term ``covered school'' means an 
        elementary school, a secondary school, or an institution of 
        higher education.
            (2) ESEA terms.--The terms ``elementary school'', ``local 
        educational agency'', ``secondary school'', and ``State'' have 
        the meanings given those terms in section 8101 of the 
        Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
        7801).
            (3) Institution of higher education.--The term 
        ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given that 
        term in section 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 
        U.S.C. 1002).
            (4) Promote.--The term ``promote'', when used with respect 
        to a race-based theory described in subsection (c), means--
                    (A) to include such theories or materials that 
                advocate such theories in curricula, reading lists, 
                seminars, workshops, trainings, or other educational or 
                professional settings in a manner that could reasonably 
                give rise to the appearance of official sponsorship, 
                approval, or endorsement;
                    (B) to contract with, hire, or otherwise engage 
                speakers, consultants, diversity trainers, and other 
                persons for the purpose of advocating such theories;
                    (C) to compel students to profess a belief in such 
                theories; or
                    (D) to segregate students or other individuals by 
                race in any setting, including in educational or 
                training sessions.
                                 <all>
