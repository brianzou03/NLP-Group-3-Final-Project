  To amend title 5, United States Code, to prohibit Federal employees

amended by adding at the end the following:

     ``SUBCHAPTER VIII--PROHIBITION ON FEDERAL EMPLOYEE CENSORSHIP

``Sec. 7381. Policy regarding Federal employee censorship
    ``It is the policy of the Congress that employees acting in their 
official capacity should neither take action within their authority or 
influence to promote the censorship of any lawful speech, nor advocate 
that a third party, including a private entity, censor such speech.

Requirements.--

   To provide public health veterinary services to Indian Tribes and 
  Tribal organizations for rabies prevention, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterinary Services to Improve 
Public Health in Rural Communities Act''.

<DELETED>SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) human, animal, and environmental health are 
        interdependent in Native communities, Alaska Native villages, 
        and on Indian reservations, and holistic approaches to the 
        well-being of all individuals will lead to improved health 
        outcomes and enhanced resilience;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) uncontrolled animal populations and a lack of 
        veterinary care in Native communities, Alaska Native villages, 
        and on Indian reservations increase the risk of parasites and 
        zoonotic diseases, dog bites, food insecurity, and mental 
        health issues among Alaska Natives and American 
        Indians;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) dog bites and other injuries are common in 
        rural areas in the State of Alaska, with the Norton Sound 
        Health Corporation reporting an average of 87 bites per year in 
        the Bering Strait region between 2016 and 2023, and the Yukon-
        Kuskokwim Health Corporation reporting an average of 98 bites 
        per year in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region between 2008 and 
        2017;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) Alaska Native children have the highest 
        incidence of hospitalization for dog bites in the Indian Health 
        Service system;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) in 2021, St. Lawrence Island, Alaska, 
        experienced co-occurring outbreaks of rabies and canine 
        distemper;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) canine distemper is almost 100 percent fatal 
        in marine mammals, which the people of the Native Villages of 
        Savoonga and Gambell rely on heavily as a food 
        source;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (7) rabies is enzootic in arctic and red fox 
        populations in the northern and western coastal regions of the 
        State of Alaska;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (8) wildlife outbreaks occur cyclically, and there 
        have been increased human exposures to rabid animals between 
        2020 and 2023;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (9) rabies transmission is a significant threat in 
        Alaska Native communities and villages; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (10) as of 2024, the Indian Health Service does 
        not employ or use public health veterinarians to combat 
        zoonotic disease outbreaks or to generally advance public 
        health preparedness for Native communities, Alaska Native 
        villages, or Indian reservations, including by providing spay 
        and neuter services and vaccinations for animals.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
the Indian Health Service of the Department of Health and Human 
Services is uniquely suited to empower Indian Tribes and Tribal 
organizations to address zoonotic disease threats in the communities 
they serve by providing public health veterinary services through a One 
Health approach that recognizes the interconnection between people, 
animals, plants, and their shared environment.</DELETED>

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the Indian Health Service of the 
Department of Health and Human Services is uniquely suited to empower 
Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations to address zoonotic disease 
threats in the communities they serve by providing public health 
veterinary services through a One Health approach that recognizes the 
interconnection between people, animals, plants, and their shared 
environment.

118th CONGRESS
  1st Session
                                 S. 556

To prohibit the United States Armed Forces from promoting anti-American 
                          and racist theories.


_______________________________________________________________________


                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           February 28, 2023

 Mr. Cotton (for himself, Mr. Daines, Mrs. Blackburn, Mr. Lee, and Mr. 
   Lankford) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and 
              referred to the Committee on Armed Services

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To prohibit the United States Armed Forces from promoting anti-American 
                          and racist theories.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Combating Racist Training in the 
Military Act of 2023''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The founding principles of the United States include 
        the belief, enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, that 
        ``all men are created equal'' and ``are endowed by their 
        Creator with certain unalienable Rights''.
            (2) The United States commitment to the equal dignity and 
        natural rights of all mankind is the strongest possible defense 
        against racism and oppression of all kinds.
            (3) The mission of the United States Armed Forces is to 
        ``support and defend the Constitution of the United States 
        against all enemies, foreign and domestic'' and ``bear true 
        faith and allegiance to the same''.
            (4) To carry out this mission, the Armed Forces must train 
        leaders who love the United States, its citizens, and the 
        aforementioned founding principles.
            (5) Anti-American and racist theories, such as ``Critical 
        Race Theory'', teach that the United States is a fundamentally 
        racist Nation, that the Constitution is a fundamentally racist 
        document, and that certain races are fundamentally oppressive 
        or oppressed.
            (6) Such theories encourage people to judge and treat 
        others differently on the basis of their race, rather than 
        treating them as equal citizens and human beings with equal 
        dignity and protection under the law.
            (7) Anti-American and racist theories, such as Critical 
        Race Theory, teach students to distrust and even hate their 
        country and fellow citizens.
            (8) The United States Armed Forces should not promote or 
        otherwise encourage anti-American and racist theories that 
        demoralize and divide its members while undermining its mission 
        to ``bear true faith and allegiance'' to the Constitution.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON PROMOTION OF ANTI-AMERICAN AND RACIST THEORIES.

    (a) In General.--The United States Armed Forces and academic 
institutions operated or controlled by the Department of Defense shall 
not promote the following anti-American and racist theories:
            (1) Any race is inherently superior or inferior to any 
        other race.
            (2) The United States of America is a fundamentally racist 
        country.
            (3) The Declaration of Independence or the United States 
        Constitution are fundamentally racist documents.
            (4) An individual's moral character or worth is determined 
        by his or her race.
            (5) An individual, by virtue of his or her race, is 
        inherently racist or oppressive, whether consciously or 
        unconsciously.
            (6) An individual, because of his or her race, bears 
        responsibility for the actions committed by other members of 
        his or her race.
    (b) Promote Defined.--In this section, the term ``promote'' means 
the following:
            (1) Including theories described under subsection (a) or 
        materials that advocate such theories in curricula, reading 
        lists, seminars, workshops, trainings, or other educational or 
        professional settings in a manner that could reasonably give 
        rise to the appearance of official sponsorship, approval, or 
        endorsement.
            (2) Contracting with, hiring, or otherwise engaging 
        speakers, consultants, diversity trainers, and other persons 
        for the purpose of advocating theories described under 
        subsection (a).
            (3) Compelling members of the Armed Forces to affirm or 
        profess belief in theories described under subsection (a).
            (4) Segregating members of the Armed Forces or other 
        individuals by race in any setting, including educational and 
        training sessions.
    (c) Rules of Construction.--
            (1) Protected speech not restricted.--Nothing in this 
        section shall be construed to restrict the protected speech of 
        members of the Armed Forces or any individual.
            (2) Access to materials for the purpose of research or 
        independent study.--Nothing in this section shall be construed 
        to prevent individuals from accessing materials that advocate 
        theories described under subsection (a) for the purpose of 
        research or independent study.
            (3) Contextual education.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        construed to prevent the United States Armed Forces and 
        academic institutions operated or controlled by the Department 
        of Defense from stating theories described under subsection (a) 
        or assigning materials that advocate such theories for 
        educational purposes in contexts that make clear the United 
        States Armed Forces and Department of Defense does not sponsor, 
        approve, or endorse such theories or works.

                                 Day''.

Whereas it is essential for youth to learn and practice the art of communicating

Whereas speech and debate education offers students myriad forms of public 
        speaking through which students may develop talent and exercise unique 
        voice and character;
Whereas speech and debate education gives students the 21st century skills of 
        communication, critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration;
Whereas critical analysis and effective communication allow important ideas, 
        texts, and philosophies the opportunity to flourish;
Whereas personal, professional, and civic interactions are enhanced by the 
        ability of the participants in those interactions to listen, concur, 
        question, and dissent with reason and compassion;
Whereas students who participate in speech and debate have chosen a challenging 
        activity that requires regular practice, dedication, and hard work;
Whereas teachers and coaches of speech and debate devote in-school, afterschool, 
        and weekend hours to equip students with life-changing skills and 
        opportunities;
Whereas National Speech and Debate Education Day emphasizes the lifelong impact 
        of providing people of the United States with the confidence and 
        preparation to both discern and share views;
Whereas National Speech and Debate Education Day acknowledges that most 
        achievements, celebrations, commemorations, and pivotal moments in 
        modern history begin, end, or are crystallized with public address;
Whereas National Speech and Debate Education Day recognizes that learning to 
        research, construct, and present an argument is integral to personal 
        advocacy, social movements, and the making of public policy;
Whereas the National Speech & Debate Association, in conjunction with national 
        and local partners, honors and celebrates the importance of speech and 
        debate through National Speech and Debate Education Day; and
Whereas National Speech and Debate Education Day emphasizes the importance of 
        speech and debate education and the integration of speech and debate 
        education across grade levels and disciplines: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates March 1, 2024, as ``National Speech and 
        Debate Education Day'';
            (2) strongly affirms the purposes of National Speech and
